# Carpooling
Its a web application that enables sharing of travel and travel expenses.
The owner (uploader) who is going to travel by his/her vehicle will mention source,destination,route selected and the capacity of the vehicle. The user (passenger) who find the path convenient can register for the trip. To make this ubiquitous it must be universally available in the internet as a web application, hence it's implemented in ASP.NET and C#.
